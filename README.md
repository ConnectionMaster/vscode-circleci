## Configuring

Create an API token in your [CircleCI dashboard](https://circleci.com/account/api)
and add it to your workspace configuration file. Keys from the repo settings page will not work.

**Settings:**
`circleci.apiKey`: _String_. API key you create in your [CircleCI dashboard](https://circleci.com/account/api)
`circleci.rate`: _Number_. How often this extension will refresh status for the current branch. In seconds. Default: 10.

**Enjoy!**
